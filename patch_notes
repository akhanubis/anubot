A new version of anubot is here!
-------------------------------------

Apollo update is focused in providing the ultimate listening experience: more queue related commands, better audio quality, Spotify and YT support, and a few QoL improvements

**What's new in  1.2.0?**

```
• Added support for Spotify artists, playlists, tracks and albums to the !play command (e. g. !play https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0hDp1l2gfmaLY6SSZNOWHf?si=u7ICuWZLRMKMxW6-QBWleg)
• Added support for YouTube search by keywords to the !play command (e. g. !play 7 rings ariana)
• Added !next command which skips the current song
• Added !stop command which stops the currently playing song and clears the queue
• Added !queue command which prints out the currently playing song and a list of queued songs
• Added song related command shortcuts (!p => !play, !n => !next, !s => !stop, !q => !queue)
• Added !queue command as an alias for !play when called with extra arguments
• Fixed a bug where the first song played right after anubot joined a voice channel wasnt playing any sound
• Added some super secret administrator stuff
```
